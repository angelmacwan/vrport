            Virtual reality in manufacturing is referred to as digital design, simulation, and integration.

        <p>Virtual reality and Augmented reality are already taking over the way we see the world around us. Almost
            every single industry is using these technologies to enhance their productivity and get work done faster and
            with much more accuracy.</p>


        <h1>Augmented reality, for real
        </h1>
        <p>AR and VR are tools to help with each of the above elements, building even more engagement with customers.
            From early sales and marketing encounters with customers, through those customers’ purchase and use of the
            products and into the realm of customer service and support, AR and VR are becoming more and more useful.
        </p>

        <h1>Virtual reality, for real
        </h1>
        <p>VR applications, meanwhile, enable customers to immerse themselves in a digital space such as a hospital,
            laboratory or oil refinery illustrating how complex products and solutions work and helping them understand
            how they would navigate and use these new products. At Cisco Live in June 2017, Dell EMC utilized a VR
            application developed by my company, Kaon Interactive, for its enterprise prospects and customers.

        <h1>VR and AR in industries
        </h1>
        <p>
            Companies like FORD, IKEA, FACEBOOK, BMW, etc are using VR and AR technology for purposes like
            manufacturing, training, visualization, and advertising. FORD is focused on manufacturing aspect while IKEA
            and BMW are using AR for a better user experience and advertisement.

        <p>
            Virtual reality allows designers and engineers to interact with their designs in a more meaningful way than
            they can with a 2D CAD or even a 3D rendering. The potential for exploring and expanding designs to better
            suit the operators and maintenance workers are almost endless.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, Boeing is already celebrating the capabilities of virtual reality for their manufacturing process,
            touting its ability to improve both flight desk design and maintainability.

            <li class="list-group-item">
                The designer can easily explore and create mock-ups or prototypes to find the best ways to create a

            <li class="list-group-item">
                Decision-making time is cut down as concepts and options can be reviewed, adjusted and modified quickly.

            <li class="list-group-item">
                The result is rapid iterative design cycles with appropriate validation in the early phases of product

            VR and AR are been used in large organizations for quite a few years in order to keep up with the latest
            trends. But for the small-scale organizations and start-ups, affording this tech would cost a fortune.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the technology developed, it became better with a surprising reduction in the cost which makes it
            available to a broad range of audience including small-scale industries. Recent updates in software and
            hardware have resulted in more simple and cost-effective solutions for using AR and VR in industries.
        </p>
        <p>
            The implications for small companies seeking to adopt VR for manufacturing have moved aware from the cost
            barrier, as the price of tools has fallen significantly in recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
            As technology is becoming more and more affordable and practical, a wide range of industries is using VR and
            AR.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the major problems face by small-scale industries and start-ups like “early testing, prototyping,
            safety, agility, and design complexities” can be overcome by the use of AR and VR technology.

            <li class="list-group-item">Concept, prototyping, and traditional design can be incredibly lengthy and
                resource-intensive processes. They also require several revisions and back-and-forth communications

            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">That’s before anything is even passed to production and manufacturing, which

            <li class="list-group-item">AR / VR make it easier to analyze data and visualize the outcomes in a real

        <h1>Safety, a concern

        <p>
            When it comes to actual manufacturing, Safety becomes a concern for the company. So, proper training is a
            must for employees, but training them in an actual environment can be risky and hence, a virtual environment
            can be created to train the employees away from the actual danger and in a fully controlled environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this manner, as the virtual environment can be manipulated, people can be trained under all possible
            conditions they may face in the real process of manufacturing.

            As technology is becoming more and affordable and advanced, industries have adopted the trend and have
            already started to use AR and VR in various fields of work in order to increase productivity and overcome

            Experts are confident that, as faster processors, better software and even more powerful cameras are
            developed, the scope for using applications that support virtual and expanded reality will increase
            significantly when compared with today. While many video gamers already consider the technology to be
            standard, industrial development for the technology is just getting started and, with a new generation of AR
            and VR glasses, entirely new applications will be created with potential benefits for several industries at
            once. It is even conceivable that augmented reality will no longer be transmitted via glasses in future, but
            by contact lenses or an implant to the optic nerve instead.
